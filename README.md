# Pokémon Game 

A console-based role-playing game inspired by Pokémon, implemented in **C++** with **object-oriented programming principles** and a **ncurses-based UI**.  
This project demonstrates advanced **OOP design patterns**, **SOLID principles**, and the use of **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** to create a modular and extensible game engine.  

---

## Features
- Class hierarchy for different Pokémon types (`FirePokemon`, `WaterPokemon`, `GrassPokemon`, etc.)  
- Turn-based **battle system** with type advantages  
- **Exploration system** with text-based UI (built with `ncurses`)  
- Modular architecture applying **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **templates**  
- Easy to extend with new Pokémon, moves, or mechanics
